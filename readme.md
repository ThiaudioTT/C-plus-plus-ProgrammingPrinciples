# Hello!

> "Programming is the art of expressing solutions to problems so that a computer 
can execute those solutions. Much of the effort in programming is spent finding 
and refining solutions. Often, a problem is only fully understood through the 
process of programming a solution for it." ~Stroustrup

This is my reading about the [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KPTEH8C/)

See more about the author in [here](https://www.stroustrup.com/).

# Objective

I've created this repository on Github to my persona in the future see how I changed. Probably you'll see messy code in the early of chapters here, but that is how it is. Sometimes we first know how to to do wrong for to do right later.

Maybe the answers here isn't 100% perfect. Learning is a continuous process.
This is only a guided C++ study. And should not only be the unique material to learn. It's important to do other projects and learn from it.

Like the book itself says about exercises: "We do not expect you to do them all, but feel free to try". We have many sources to learn, so not doing an unique exercise won't harm you at all.

For more, read chapter 0.

# About readme.md files in the chapters:

## Interesting Topics
Interesting Topics are topics, that I learned reading the book or other thing, who probably I will use later. They are nest within the `readme.md` file in each chapter.
