## Hello!

> "Programming is the art of expressing solutions to problems so that a computer 
can execute those solutions. Much of the effort in programming is spent finding 
and refining solutions. Often, a problem is only fully understood through the 
process of programming a solution for it." ~Stroustrup

This is my reading about the [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KPTEH8C/)
