1. What is the difference between a declaration and a definition?
R: 8.2
Declaration is a statement that introduces a name into a scope.
Definition is when the program alocate memory and defines that var/function.

2. How do we syntactically distinguish between a function declaration and 
a function definition?
R: By the curly brackets {}; When a function have curly brackets, we are defining it.

3. How do we syntactically distinguish between a variable declaration and a 
variable definition?
R:
variable declaration have the  keyword extern, meaning that the linker will search for the 
definition of that variable. Variables that don't have the statement extern are by default definitions.

4. Why can’t you use the functions in the calculator program from Chapter 6 without declaring them first?
R: Ch8.2
Because every name in a C++ program has to be declared before it is used.

5. Is int a; a definition or just a declaration?
R:
Declaration and definition.

6. Why is it a good idea to initialize variables as they are declared?
R:
To avoid errors.

7. What can a function declaration consist of?
R: return type, name of the function and arguments of the function.

8. What good does indentation do?
R: 8.4
Make the code readable

9. What are header files used for?
R: 8.3
To manage declarations.

10. What is the scope of a declaration?
R: 8.4
In its scope.

11. What kinds of scope are there? Give an example of each.
R:8.4
Global scope -> they don't have a scope.
namespace scope: a named scope nested in the global scope or in another 
namespace;
class scope: the area of text within a class
local scope: between { . . . } braces of a block or in a function argument list
statement scope: e.g., in a for-statement

12. What is the difference between a class scope and local scope?
R: 8.4
A class scope: the area of text within a class; see §9.2
A local scope: between { . . . } braces of a block or in a function argument list

13. Why should a programmer minimize the number of global variables?
R: To avoid clashes/errors/bugs.

14. What is the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference?
R: 8.5
Pass by value: The argument is copied to a new variable inside that scope.
Pass by reference: Not a single one variable is created and we modify the var itself.

15. What is the difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-const-reference?
R: 8.5.4
Pass by reference will modify the argument, const reference won't.

16. What is a swap()?
R: A function from standard library who swap two values.

17. Would you ever define a function with a vector<double>-by-value 
parameter?
R: 8.5.4
Not always, sometimes is better to computer memory to use pass-by-reference instead.

18. Give an example of undefined order of evaluation. Why can undefined 
order of evaluation be a problem?
R: Read ch8.6.1
it’s bad because 
you can’t rely on the results being the same if you move your code to another 
computer, use a different compiler, or use a different optimizer setting.

v[i] = ++i;

19. What do x&&y and x||y, respectively, mean?
R:
Logical operators will return if the statement are true, so:

x && y -> x AND y
x || y -> x OR y

20. Which of the following is standard-conforming C++: functions within 
functions, functions within classes, classes within classes, classes within 
functions?
R: ----

21. What goes into an activation record?
R: 8.5.8
A stack call (stack of activation records)

22. What is a call stack and why do we need one?
R:
Is a data structure that use the methodology: first in, first out. We use it for many applications.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack

23. What is the purpose of a namespace?
R:8.7
To avoid clashes and errors with other classes names.


24. How does a namespace differ from a class?
R:
by keyword namespace

25. What is a using declaration?
R:
Is used to introduce namespace into the scope.

26. Why should you avoid using directives in a header?
R: 8.7.1
The problem with overuse of using directives is that you lose track of which 
names come from where, so that you again start to get name clashes.
This contradicts the use of namespaces.

27. What is namespace std?
