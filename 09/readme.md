When we program, we always have to ask ourselves what is good enough
for a given application. We usually don’t have the luxury of being able to search
“forever” for the perfect solution after we have already found one that is good
enough. Search further, and we might even come up with something that’s so
elaborate that it is worse than the simple early solution. This is one meaning of
the saying “The best is the enemy of the good” (Voltaire).
