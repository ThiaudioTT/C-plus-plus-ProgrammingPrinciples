/*
Create a program to find all the prime numbers between 1 and 100. One 
way to do this is to write a function that will check if a number is prime 
(i.e., see if the number can be divided by a prime number smaller than 
itself) using a vector of primes in order (so that if the vector is called 
primes, primes[0]==2, primes[1]==3, primes[2]==5, etc.). Then write a 
loop that goes from 1 to 100, checks each number to see if it is a prime, 
and stores each prime found in a vector. Write another loop that lists the 
primes you found. You might check your result by comparing your vector
of prime numbers with primes. Consider 2 the first prime */
