Struct:

I will use struct for simple data structures and class for more complexity. Like the cherno does.

# Note about postcript:

"As it happens, we have now seen a simple example of how a compiler works. The 
calculator analyzes input broken down into toke ns and understood according to 
a grammar. Thatâ€™s exactly what a compiler does. 
<b>After analyzing its input, a compiler then produces a representation (object code) that we can later execute.</b> 

<b>The calculator immediately executes the expressions it has analyzed; programs that do 
this are called interpreters rather than compilers. </b>"

So, the calculator that we wrote is an interpreter.
