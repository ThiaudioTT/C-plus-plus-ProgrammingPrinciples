/*Write a program that prompts the user to enter three integer values, and
then outputs the values in numerical sequence separated by commas. So,
if the user enters the values 10 4 6, the output should be 4, 6, 10. If two
values are the same, they should just be ordered together. So, the input
4 5 4 should give 4, 4, 5.*/

/*Note: 
    There are many different ways to do this, but I will do based on the book knowledge.
    That is, according what I learned from now. And probably this is the hardest way, and I know it.
    I will refactor in the future.*/
